# System For Identifying covid19 mask violators

### Steps:
- Face Detection
- Mask Detection
- Face Recognition


Description: I have have created a system for detecting face masks and identifying face mask violators using MobileNetV2. A system will detect a person with and without a mask and recognize that person, then it gives the name/id of that person which we have stored in a database.
i have used face_recognition library for facial recognition and trained mobilenetv2 model for face mask detection.
